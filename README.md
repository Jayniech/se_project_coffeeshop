# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

A way to improve this webpage would be to add more animation. It would be nice to see the title at the top of the page to phase onto the page in some way. It would also be nice to have the circles rotate on the Book a table page.
